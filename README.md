# UniversePresence for LEGO Universe

This mod is a WIP, and is planned to add Discord rich presence functionality to LEGO Universe

## Requirements

If you're looking to contribute to this project, or just build it for yourself, you will need the following:

- CMake (needed for Rustcord)
- LLVM (x86) (needed for Rustcord)

This project uses a modified version of Rustcord (hosted on my GitHub), that fixes issues relating to it's operation.
