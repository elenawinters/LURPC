# LEGO Universe Rich Presence

This mod is incomplete. I have abandoned it for the time being, due to various reasons.

This mod provides Discord Rich Presence functionality for the LEGO Universe game client.

## Requirements

If you're looking to contribute to this project, or just build it for yourself, you will need the following:

- CMake (needed for Rustcord)
- LLVM (x86) (needed for Rustcord)

This project uses a modified version of Rustcord (hosted on my GitHub), that fixes issues relating to it's operation.

## Special Thanks
